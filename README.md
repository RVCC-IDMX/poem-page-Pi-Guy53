  'Theme in Yellow' By Carl Sandburg is a poem about pumpkins, seemingly told from the pumpkins perspective as it grows, and is eventually harvested. 

  The background image is from Ginevra Austine on Unsplash, and is a picture of a small pumpkin/gord patch, and I feel that this fits together nicely with the content of the poem.
